<P>
Nolan Park is named for Major General Dennis Edward Nolan (1872-1956), the commander of First Army on Governors Island from 1933 to 1936. Laid out around 1871, the park was referred to as "The Green" in 19th Century accounts. It provided a park-like setting for the administrative buildings and officers' housing built there from 1855-1891. The park contains a wide variety of trees, many of which are quite large and may date to the island's very early history.
<P>
Several commemorative markers and military artifacts are exhibited in and around Nolan Park, including an account of the island's purchase by Wouter Van Twiller in 1637, donated to the Army in 1951 by the Holland Society. The diagonal walks crossing the park date from the 19th Century. The smaller paths fronting the houses and other buildings probably date from the  1930s, when the WPA was carrying out extensive landscape work on the island.
<P>
When the Army ran the island, Nolan Park was for the exclusive use of officers' and their family members. Enlisted men were not permitted in the park (unless they were mowing the grass or shoveling snow from the walkways). When the island was opened to the public, Nolan Park quickly took on a new life. It has been used for interactive art displays, fashion shows, and games. Be sure to look for the historic markers sprinkled around it.
<P>
The park's namesake, General Nolan, was born in Akron, New York. An 1896 West Point graduate, General Nolan fought in the Spanish-American War, the Philippine-American War, and World War I. In France he served as General John J. Pershing's intelligence chief, and is often called the father of American military intelligence. Nolan retired in 1936. He is interred in Arlington National Cemetery, Section 30, Site 604.
