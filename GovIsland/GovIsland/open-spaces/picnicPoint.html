<!-- BEGIN DESCRIPTION HERE --> 

<span class="title">Picnic Point</span> 

<div id="copy">

Southwestern Corner
<P>
The newest open space on Governors Island was created only in 2009, when ten non-historic apartment buildings were demolished. A catchy name for the spot sprung up, and Picnic Point quickly became a beloved destination.
<P>
This spot has seen many uses in the 100 years since the landfill was used to create the southern end of Governors Island. During the two world wars, rows of temporary warehouses lined the area. The engine house of the Governors Island Railroad was located here. When the Coast Guard built Liberty Village in 1988, the neighborhood was nicknamed Foghorn Alley. The "coasties" added picnic tables and erected a bandstand (also demolished) here. Today, Picnic Point is an eight acre green space that features unique views of the Statue of Liberty and New York Harbor; it is a prime spot to look at the face of Lady Liberty.
<P>
Picnic Point is on the Island's southwestern corner, approximately 1 mile or a 20-minute walk from both ferry landings. Visitors can also bicycle to Picnic Point. Tram service is also available to visitors on public days.
