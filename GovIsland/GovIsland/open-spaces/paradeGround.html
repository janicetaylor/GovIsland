South of Fort Jay
<P>
The most charming open space on Governors Island is the parade ground, a gently sloping grassy spot that lies to the south of Fort Jay. The 12-acre parade ground has played an important part in island life for more than 200 years, and since the public was allowed to roam free, it has seen everything from kite flying to outdoor concerts. The parade ground served a crucial military function when Fort Jay was built in 1811. The glacis&#8212the open field&#8212extended away from the fort so that army gunners had a clear view of the harbor and approaching enemy ships.

After the military use of the island changed, the parade ground's uses did too. During the Civil War, public disciplinary measures for Confederate prisoners were conducted on it, including executions, the only bloodshed the island has seen. In the early 20th Century, the parade ground was used to drill troops and hold annual lawn parties for VIP guests. During World War I soldiers trained on the parade ground for battle; after the war they held mock re-enactments here for visitors.

In the 1920s, a 9-hole golf course was created; it was enjoyed by Army and Coast Guard duffers for 80 years. From 1946 to 1996 the parade ground-golf course was used for anniversary celebrations and open house events. For many years, a guesthouse and tennis courts were on the southeast side of the parade ground. The Coast Guard put up a 45-room Super 8 Motel in 1986; the motel and an adjoining parking area were demolished in 2008, adding two acres of open space. In 2010, the Governors Island Alliance presented Let's Fly a Kite, a free kite giveaway, for hundreds of visitors.
