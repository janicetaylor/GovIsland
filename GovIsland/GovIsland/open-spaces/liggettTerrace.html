Between Liggett Hall and Division Road<P>

The Trust For Governors Island carved up this nice little green space just recently in the couple of acres of lawn in front of Liggett Hall. This whole green space was landfill created in 1901, when the Army Corps of Engineers added 100 acres of new land to the island, some of it from fill from subway excavation in Manhattan. Although the Coast Guard left a parking lot here, this will be demolished soon; flowerbeds and landscaping will take its place. The new Liggett Terrace is quickly becoming a must-visit destination for artists. FIGMENT, the annual participatory arts festival on the island, has made itself at home on Liggett Terrace. In the summer of 2011, it will be creating an eco-friendly pavilion made of inflatable tubes and soil.

Who was Liggett? In 1957, Building 400 was named Liggett Hall by the Army to honor First Army Commander Lieutenant General Hunter Liggett (1857-1935). General Liggett spent more than four decades in uniform; his service spanned the Indian Wars to World War I. When General John J. Pershing ordered that the first American Army Corps be formed in January 1918, he placed General Liggett in command. The corps participated in the battles of Cantigny and Belleau Wood, as well as in operations of the second Marne campaign.
