South Island Field is located in an area of Governors Island that is closed to the public. The field is available by permit only to organized groups such as youth sports leagues and music promoters.
<P>
South Island Field has seen a wide variety of uses since the landfill was completed 100 years ago. It's been used for polo ponies, drilling soldiers, landing airplanes, and even the world's shortest railroad, which ran less than a mile to the tip of the island during World War I. In the Interwar Period there was a polo field here. For 35 years, warehouses, enlisted men's barracks, and storerooms lined the streets here. In the 1950s, the Army landed helicopters on the field. When the Coast Guard moved in, they carved it up into softball diamonds and tennis courts, and built a school and apartments on the northern end (both since demolished).
<P>
Today, South Island Field is the biggest open space on Governors Island, at more than 22 acres. It is used several times a season for large events. Headlines on both sides of the Atlantic were made when HRH Prince Harry of Wales played polo on South Island Field in 2009 and 2010. During the Veuve Clicquot Polo Classic, the polo grounds attracted several thousand spectators to support Prince Harry's charity, Sentebale, to help children and young people in Lesotho, particularly those who have been orphaned as a result of HIV and AIDS.
<P>
Large outdoor concerts, some drawing more than 7,000 fans, started getting booked here in 2008. Punk Island brought more than 100 punk rock bands for three years in a row; this was followed by many hip hop artists. Among the musicians to perform here have been Lauryn Hill, Snoop Dogg, A Tribe Called Quest, Wu-Tang Clan and Passion Pit. A new music series, the Governors Ball Music Festival, begins here in June 2011.
