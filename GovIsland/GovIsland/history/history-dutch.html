<span class="title">The Dutch 1624-1674</span> 

<div id="copy">

When first encountered by European explorers, the Canarsee Indians who populated the general area of what came to be known as New Netherland called Governors Island Pagganck. It is likely, though not documented, that the Italian explorer Giovanni Verrazano sighted the island when he entered New York Harbor in 1524. Eighty-five years later, Henry Hudson sailed into the Harbor through the Narrows. He too would have seen the island, but it was navigator Adriaen Block (1567-1627), in search of "Hudson's River," who first noted the "Nutt Island" in his travel log while journeying in Hellegat and the Long Island Sound in 1614. Pagganck Island was home to many groves of hickory, oak and chestnut trees, hence the Dutch translation, Noten, Nutten, or Nutt.
<P>
With the arrival of the first shipload of colonists sent by the Dutch West India Company in 1624, Nutten Island was one of several points of settlement along the Hudson River. A year earlier, the <I>Mackerel</I>, one of the first ships chartered under the newly-organized company, is believed to have served as a "sort of official scout," and it "seems also practically certain that the <I>Mackerel</I> established a fort on Noten Island," according to author I. N. Phelps Stokes.
<P>
When the Walloons, French-speaking Protestants from Wallonia, in southern Belgium, arrived in Niew Nederlandt in 1624, they had with them several supply ships and the engineer Cryn Fredericksen, who was charged with laying out a fort and town. The cattle were unloaded onto Nutten Island, where they remained two days before being moved to "Manhates" for better pasturing. The second Director of New Netherland, Willem Verhulst, arrived shortly thereafter, gathered the settlers from small settlements along the Delaware and Connecticut rivers, and moved the majority first to Nutten Island and then to Nieuw Amsterdam.
<P>
Peter Minuit (1580-1638) arrived in 1626 as the third Director General; his purchase of Manhattan Island for the Dutch West India Company ensured that New Amsterdam would serve as the primary settlement in the area. Nutten Island continued to play a role in the little settlement&#8212most immediately, the company established a sawmill on the island, and leased its then plentiful nut trees for timbering.
<P>
In 1637, the fourth Director General of New Netherland, Wouter Van Twiller (1606-1654), purchased Nutten Island for his private use. In a ceremony in the presence of his council, Van Twiller paid two representatives of the Canarsee a string of beads, some nails, and two axe heads for the island, upon which he reportedly built a house and pastured his goats. This was the only time the island was privately owned; it reverted back to the colony after Van Twiller was sacked and sent home.
<P>
In 1625, the Dutch had 103 head of cattle sent over and landed on Nutten Island. Surveyors at the time estimated it was 80 Dutch morgens, about 160 acres. At low tide, a narrow, sedge-filled creek separated its eastern shore from Long Island's Vlachte Bos, later Anglicized into Flatbush.
<P>
The last Dutch Director-General, Peter Stuyvesant (1612-1672), had the narrow waterway between the island and Brooklyn widened and dredged. This channel became a convenient shortcut for Long Island farmwomen to bring their produce to New Amsterdam markets via rowboats. One of their biggest sellers was dairy products, which gives the old Dutch stream its name, still in use today: Buttermilk Channel.
<P>
The Dutch had little use for Nutten Island, and it wasn't until the British ruled New York that the population of sheep, cattle and coach horses were disturbed.
