<span class="title">A New Park 1997-Present</span> 

<div id="copy">
Marine One, the official presidential helicopter, dipped its big rotors as it soared over Governors Island on a fall morning in October 1995. Looking out a window, President Bill Clinton pointed to the island passing below. "What is that?" he asked his passenger. "Governors Island, sir," replied Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, one of New York's legendary public servants. The senator informed the president that the U.S. Coast Guard had just announced its intention to leave the island, the same island that New York had turned over to Uncle Sam in 1800. The senator asked if the state could have it back.
<P>
"Done," said Clinton. The president presented his terms before the chopper touched down at the East River heliport: The price was one dollar; just open it to the public.
<P>
Moynihan believed it would be a smooth process for the state to get the land back from the federal government. But it took until 2003 for it to happen. Clinton did indeed transfer the island back to the people of New York for $1. However, there were numerous hurdles to get over: the General Services Administration was eyeing a potential $500 million real estate bonanza, a sale that never took place; neither New York State or the City of New York had the money to fund the island's $10 million-a-year maintenance bill. When the property was finally transferred to New York on Jan. 31, 2003, nobody was happier than the senator that championed it. "It's like getting another borough," he told the New York <I>Times</I>.
<P>
Governor George Pataki and Mayor Michael Bloomberg set in motion the process to turn the military base into a public park. An early decision was to launch the Governors Island Preservation and Education Corporation (GIPEC). The city-state agency would run the island, plan its development, and market the park to the public. At the same time, the National Park Service had dibs on a portion of the land that contained Castle Williams and Fort Jay. In 2001, President George W. Bush signed the order to create the Governors Island National Monument, 22 acres that would join 390 other parks in the National Park System. Today the National Monument is part of the National Parks of New York Harbor, run by the same park rangers as the Statue of Liberty, the General Grant Memorial, Federal Hall and 20 other national treasures.
<P>
When GIPEC gave the green light, the ferries began bringing over visitors that were incredibly eager to explore the new park. In 2004, over just a few weeks in the summer, 4,000 visitors explored a small part of the island. In 2010 that number had climbed to 450,000. GIPEC and the National Park Service reached out to the public with innovative and unique offerings, from art exhibitions, live music, tours and polo matches. Governors Island was a sensational success.
<P>
The development of the park from 2003-2010 was taken in careful strides. GIPEC took the lead in razing non-historic structures, starting in 2008 with the ugly Super 8 Motel, which was only 22 years old. It's demolition and tearing up the motel parking lot added two acres of open space to the Parade Grounds near South Battery. Others on the hit list were Liberty Village, 10 apartments that went up in 1998 and came down in 2008 to create Picnic Point, the 1971 elementary school and the 1983 Bachelor Officers Quarters (the enlisted mens' quarters next to Castle Williams are under the domain of the Park Service, which has stalled its demise for unknown reasons). Eventually, all buildings south of Division Road will be flattened.
<P>
Other island growth: the opening of the Urban Assembly New York Harbor School in 2010, the Earth Matter Compost in 2009, and Water Taxi Beach in a former parking lot next to the old Arsenal storehouse. Before Governors Island even got into the tourist guidebooks, GIPEC and the NPS found ways to lure visitors to the island with free bike rentals, Civil War re-enactments, and the celebrated Jazz Age Lawn Parties on Brick Row. The island has had so many unusual and quirky events in the past five years, the soldiers from years ago wouldn't recognize their old drill fields: Punk Island and its spiky-haired music fans; a zombie movie with dozens of extras roaming the grounds in full makeup; Civil War buffs in replica Blue and Gray; and hundreds and hundreds of bicyclists streaming off ferries arriving from Manhattan, Brooklyn and New Jersey. Governors Island has not been this busy since there was a war on.
<P>
In 2010 another major change to the future of the island was made. The State of New York, which had been a partner in managing the island since 2003, had to pull out due to a budget shortfall. New York City quickly stepped into the role as the sole administrator of the 150 acres that are not part of the National Monument. GIPEC was dissolved, and in its place a new corporation was founded, the Trust for Governors Island. Mayor Bloomberg appointed the board members.
<P>
"Governors Island can become one of the world's greatest public places, and we're committed to making it happen," said Mayor Bloomberg. "The new Trust for Governors Island will build on the success we've had on the island so far and lead its historic transformation going forward. The new board, a mix of public officials, non-profit and local leaders, and private sector professionals, will bring experience in civic affairs, public design, preservation and development, parks management, cultural programming and philanthropy that will help us to create a world-class destination that New Yorkers and visitors from around the world will enjoy for generations."
<P>
The new entity will implement a comprehensive strategy to redevelop Governors Island, which includes the implementation of the Governors Island Park and Public Space Master Plan. The park plan will transform 87 acres of open green space on Governors Island, rejuvenating existing landscapes in the National Historic District, revitalizing the southern half of the island with a new 40-acre park and adding a 2.2-mile Great Promenade along the waterfront.
