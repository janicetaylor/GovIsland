Water Taxi Beach<P>
There is only one place every weekend to buy and consume wine and beer, and that's on the beach. Look for the signs (and the sand) as you get off the ferry. Whenever Water Taxi Beach is open, two restaurants, the Beach Grill and the Backstage Cafe, are serving "respectfully priced" food and drink. On the menu: hamburgers, veggie burgers, hot dogs, kielbasa, knockwurst, vegan potato salad and ice cream.
<P>
The Backstage Cafe, inside the old ferry waiting room, offers "Picnic Pouches" starting at $37. All food served at the Backstage Cafe is natural, grown locally, and is antibiotic and preservative free. The Backstage Cafe practices sustainable and environmentally friendly cooking, composting and care.
