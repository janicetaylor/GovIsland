Next to the Battery Tunnel ventilation structure
<P>
Kayak to Governors Island? This is the place (on certain days; check the island's calendar). This is also the dock for ferries to Brooklyn and other smaller boats.
<P>
The passenger vessel landing dock Pier 101 was named San Juan Dock by the 16th Infantry Regiment in 1928, to commemorate the army's campaign in the Spanish-American War in 1898. There has been a dock at this point on Governors Island since at least 1800; stone steps remain from the 1820s underneath it. During World War II it was called the East Ferry slips.
<P>
Today it is the landing point for small commercial ferry service, including New York Water Taxi.
