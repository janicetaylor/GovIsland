<span class="title">Water Taxi Beach </span> 

<div id="copy">

Next to Building 110
<P>
What was once a parking lot and ferry waiting line for cars is now a beach. In July 2009, Water Taxi Beach made a big splash on what had been a couple of acres of asphalt. Tons of sand was trucked in and instantly a must-visit destination was created. With a stage in place, it became a prime location for live music. The first summer, Erykah Badu and 50 Cent were among the big-name artists to perform on Governors Island on the beach.
<P>
Whenever Water Taxi Beach is open, two restaurants, the Beach Grill and the Backstage Cafe, are serving "respectfully priced" food and drink. On the menu are hamburgers, veggie burgers, hot dogs, kielbasa, knockwurst, vegan potato salad and ice cream.     
<P>
The private company that runs the beach also opens it up for other events: For music events on nights when the Island is typically not open, transportation to and from Water Taxi Beach will be provided by New York Water Taxi for special events.  The fare will be included in your ticket price unless the concert is free. At that point, the fee aboard the New York Water Taxi is $5 round trip.After the shows, New York Water Taxi will provide service from Governors Island to  Pier 11 at Wall Street, just a few blocks South of South Street Seaport and a few blocks north of the Battery Maritime Building.
<P>
After dark, Water Taxi Beach is a playground for the 21+ crowd with live music, DJs, as well as cultural and electronic music events. For events that are 21 or older, government-issue photo ID or passports are required.
