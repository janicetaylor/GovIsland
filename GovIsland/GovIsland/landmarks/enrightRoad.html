<span class="title">Enright Road</span> 

<div id="copy">

South Island Field is open to concerts and baseball games; the road along its southeast edge is Enright Road, named for Pittsburgh native Private Thomas F. Enright, who died in World War I as one of the first Americans killed in France.
<P>
Enright was born May 8, 1887, the son of Irish immigrants. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1909. Private Enright, Corporal James B. Gresham of Evansville, Indiana, and Private Merle D. Hay of Glidden, Iowa, all serving in Company "F," 16th Infantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division, were the first Americans to die in combat during Word War I. On Nov. 3, 1917, German troops raided their trench position near the village of Bathelemont les Bauzemont, east of Nancy. Two days later, Enright, Gresham, and Hay were buried near where they had died. An inscription marked their graves: "Here lie the first soldiers of the illustrious Republic of the United States who fell on French soil for justice and liberty."
<P>
On July 16, 1921, Enright was reburied with military honors in St. Mary Catholic Cemetery in Lawrenceville, Penn. A wreath from General John J. Pershing was laid upon his grave.
