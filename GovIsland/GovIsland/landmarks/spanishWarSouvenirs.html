<div id="copy">
Facing Nolan Park
<P>
A pair of cannons, which the Army captured in Cuba and brought back from the Spanish-American war in 1899, guards the entrance to the Commanding General's House on Nolan Park. They even have names: on the left is <B>Theodorico</B>, a tip of the cap to Colonel Teddy Roosevelt, who rode up San Juan Hill with the Rough Riders, and <B>El Alejandro</B>, named for Captain Alexander M. Wetherill of the 6th U.S. Infantry, killed July 1, 1898, while leading a charge up San Juan Hill.
<P>
Both are impressive 18th-Century pieces. Theodorico is a 6,600-pound, 6.4-caliber gun made in Seville on Jan. 3, 1786. In the 19th Century it was converted into a muzzle-loading cannon. El Alejandro is an even older piece than its partner. It was made in Barcelona in October 1769. 
<P>
Bonus: Look for the special brick placed in the sidewalk between the cannons. It reads, "Commemorating the Valued Friendship of Elizabeth and Zachary Fisher and the U.S. Coast Guard." The Fishers are legends in the U.S. Armed Forces. A prominent New York builder, Zachary Fisher (1910-1999) set up the charity Fisher House Foundation to assist military families. It was his personal fortune that brought the USS Intrepid to Pier 86 in 1982.
