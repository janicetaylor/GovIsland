Between Hay Road and Building 114
<P>
From the 17th to the 19th century, scores of soldiers and their dependents were buried on Governors Island, until the two post cemeteries were closed in 1872. The remains were exhumed and moved to Cypress Hills National Cemetery in Brooklyn in 1886. However, at least seven soldiers or seamen remain buried on the island. In June 1994, a crew working on Andes Road, outside buildings 111 and 112, discovered human remains while digging an electrical trench. Work stopped and the site was inspected; later the Coast Guard nicknamed the lost souls "The Andes Men."
<P>
After the New York City Medical Examiner's office determined the remains were possibly from Colonial times (and not a crime scene), an archeological dig was undertaken with the Coast Guard's support. Working in a pit 30 by 30 feet, the remains of seven men were uncovered by a team led by archaeologist Dr. Leonore Santone. After 18 months of study, it was determined that the bones were from the late 18th or early 19th Century. One clue was the stem of a clay pipe found on the site, dating to about 1800.
<P>
On Dec. 12, 1995, with full military honors, the Coast Guard reinterred the men in a site situated between Castle Williams and Building 114, overlooking New York Harbor. The memorial marker is easily visible from Hay Road.
