<!-- BEGIN DESCRIPTION HERE --> 

<span class="title">Craig Road</span> 

<div id="copy">
In 1928, the Sixteenth Infantry Regiment named numerous island streets and avenues for American soldiers and battles. The most important road on the island&#8212now nicknamed The Great Promenade&#8212stretches almost entirely around the island, from Castle Williams to the Yankee Pier.
<P>
Craig Road was dedicated to the memory of Lieutenant Colonel John M. Craig, killed in action near Soissons, France, during the drive of July 18-19, 1918. After the commander of the front line battalion of the Sixteenth and most of the junior officers had been killed, Col. Craig voluntarily left regimental headquarters and assumed command of the assault battalion. He led a small detachment of soldiers on a reconnaissance mission, locating and destroying machine gun nests, enabling the battalion to continue its advance. He led the attack and was killed during the advance.
<P>
Col. Craig is interred in San Francisco National Cemetery.
