<!-- BEGIN DESCRIPTION HERE --> 

<span class="title">Clayton Road</span> 

<div id="copy">

One of the most picturesque roads on the island is along Regimental Row, and it's named for a famous colonel from the Gaslight Era of New York City. Clayton Road runs about where the landfill was created on the old southern shoreline.
<P>
The road is named for Colonel Bertram T. Clayton (1862-1918), a divisional quartermaster with the American Expeditionary Forces in France, killed by an enemy aerial bomb at Noyer, Oise, on May 30, 1918. Colonel Clayton graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1886. He fought in the Spanish-American War with Troop C, New York Volunteer Cavalry (Brooklyn's Own). After the war Col. Clayton was elected to Congress from the Third New York District in 1899.  He returned to active duty at the beginning of World War I; he was placed in charge of the transport service in New York, but he requested to be assigned to overseas service. Col. Clayton was quartermaster of the 1st Division in France and was the senior West Point graduate killed in action during World War I.
<P>
Col. Clayton is buried in Section 3 of Arlington National Cemetery.
