<span class="title">Hay Road</span> 

<div id="copy">

The charming tree-lined road that stretches from Castle Williams northeast along Regimental Row is Hay Road. It is named for Private Merle David Hay, one of the first Americans to die in France in World War I.
<P>
Hay was a farm boy and store clerk from Glidden, Iowa, who signed up to fight in World War I just weeks after the United States declared war on Germany. Within three weeks of enlisting, Pvt. Hay sailed to France, and a few months later he became one of the first three U.S. Army soldiers to die there. On Nov. 3, 1917, German troops killed Private Hay, along with Corporal James B. Gresham and Private Thomas F. Enright, all serving with Company "F," 16th Infantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division. The surprise attack by the Germans occurred at night, with vastly outmanned American forces engaging the enemy in hand-to-hand combat. Witnesses saw Private Hay using a bayonet to fight two German soldiers during the battle, and he was found dead after the attack. All three soldiers were buried on the battlefield where they fell.
<P>
In 1921, his remains were removed and re-interred in his hometown. The cemetery itself, previously known as West Lawn Cemetery, is also known as Merle Hay Memorial Cemetery.
