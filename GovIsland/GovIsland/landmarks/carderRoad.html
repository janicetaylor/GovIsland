<!-- BEGIN DESCRIPTION HERE --> 

<span class="title">Carder Road</span> 

<div id="copy">
This charming roadway facing Manhattan where bicyclists roam is named after a native of Corning, New York. After leaving Ohio State to accept a commission in the U.S. Army, Second Lieutenant Cyril Carder was a young officer in Company D, 16th Infantry Regiment, 1st Division, fighting in France in World War I. On July 21, 1918, near Soissons, Lt. Carder was shot in the arm and back. He refused to be evacuated, and led his platoon forward in the face of intense machine gun fire. He repeatedly exposed himself to enemy fire, and was killed in action, earning him a posthumous Distinguished Service Cross.
<P>
Lt. Carder never made it back to New York. He is interred with the rest of his company at the Oise-Aisne American Cemetery and Memorial, east of Fere-en-Tardenois, in Plot D, Row 4, Grave 25.
