<!-- BEGIN DESCRIPTION HERE --> 

<span class="title">Andes Road</span> 

<div id="copy">

The pathway into and around Fort Jay is Andes Road, named for a fallen World War I hero of the 16th Infantry Regiment from Knoxville, Tennessee. The roadway was dedicated in 1928 to Second Lieutenant James Cowan Andes, who was killed in action near Soissons, France, on July 19, 1918. Lt. Andes fearlessly led his platoon in the face of heavy machine gun fire to a cave where several hundred German soldiers had taken shelter. Rather than subject any of his men to danger, he entered the cave to seek the Germans' surrender, and was killed. Lt. Andes was awarded a posthumous Distinguished Service Cross.
<P>
His remains were never recovered, and his name is engraved on the Tablets of the Missing at Aisne-Marne American Cemetery in Belleau.
