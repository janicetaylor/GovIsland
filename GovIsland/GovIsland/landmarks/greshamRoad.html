<!-- BEGIN DESCRIPTION HERE --> 

<span class="title">Gresham Road</span> 

<div id="copy">

Gresham Road runs parallel to Craig Road North, from Division Road to Picnic Point. The first three American soldiers to die in World War I were from Governors Island's own Sixteenth Infantry Regiment; in 1928 island roads were commemorated in their honor.
<P>
James Bethel Gresham was a factory worker in Evansville, Indiana, when on April 23, 1914, he enlisted in the U.S. Army. In June 1917, as part of Company "F," 16th Infantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division, Corporal Gresham was part of the first group of American troops sent to France. In the pre-dawn hours of Nov. 3, 1917, German soldiers attacked the Americans in their trenches near the village of Bathelemont les Bauzemont, east of Nancy. The Americans were vastly outnumbered, and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. At the end of the encounter, three American soldiers were dead. Corporal Gresham, along with Privates Thomas F. Enright and Merle D. Hay, were buried on the battlefield where they fell. Corporal Gresham was later reburied in the American Cemetery in Bathlemon, France.
<P>
In 1921 his remains were returned to Evansville, and buried in Locust Hill Cemetery. A cenotaph dedicated to Corporal Gresham stands in Indianapolis on the American Legion Mall.
