<!-- BEGIN DESCRIPTION HERE --> 

<span class="title">Last British Cannon</span> 

<div id="copy">

Andes Road, Facing Soissons Dock<P>
When the English army pulled out of their garrison on Governors Island in 1783, they took all of their heavy cannons and ammunition stores with them. However, they left one cannon behind, and it is the one that all visitors landing on Governors Island at Soissons Docks see when they walk up the hill onto the island. Look carefully at it to note the Royal Cipher "GR" on the top, which means "George Reigns," a reference to King George III. It is now ignobly part of a traffic circle, and signage is attached around the perimeter, hiding this 250-year-old British relic.
