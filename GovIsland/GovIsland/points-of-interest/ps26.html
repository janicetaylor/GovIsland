<P>
In 1934 a small school was built which turned into the Child Development Daycare Center for the Coast Guard. That school, P.S. 26, went up to the eighth grade and was affiliated with P.S. 3 in Manhattan. As the number of children on the island increased, the little school grew and wings were added to the building in 1959-60. In 1971 a new school was built near Liggett Hall (it was demolished in 2009).
<P>
The old school consisted of classrooms, a library, and an auditorium that doubled as a gym. There was no lunchroom because the children went home for lunch. This school building was constructed in 1934 when the army base at Governors Island expanded to accommodate the needs of the 16th Regiment. The architect, Eric Kebbon (1891-1964), designed more than 100 schools in New York and numerous post offices and courthouses around the United States.
<P>
The neo-Georgian design is not only compatible with the many residential structures built on the base at the time, but was also one that was popular for public school design. The incorporation of a cast stone eagle placed in the pediment of the entrance pavilion is particularly appropriate for a school on a military base; Kebbon served in World War I in the Army Corps of Engineers and it's a nice touch.
<P>
After the construction of a larger public school on the portion the island which is outside the boundaries of the historic district, this building was converted to a daycare center.
