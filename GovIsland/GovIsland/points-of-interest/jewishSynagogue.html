<!-- BEGIN DESCRIPTION HERE --> 

<span class="title">Jewish Synagogue (S-40) </span> 

<div id="copy">

East of Barry Road, behind Bldg 8
<P>
The former Jewish Synagogue Shaare Shomayim (Hebrew for "Gates of Heaven") occupied Building S-40, a one-story rectangular frame structure built in 1918. The building is just off Barry Road, behind General's Row. The original wood siding was laid vertically; this has been replaced by horizontal clapboard. Building S-40 was originally constructed for temporary storage in 1918 as the Army was expanding its facilities on the island during World War I.
<P>
In the mid-20th century (perhaps the 1960s) it was converted for purposes of Jewish worship and as a meeting space. After the building was converted to a synagogue-the date is unknown-a Jewish star and Hebrew letters reading beit haknesset ("house of assembly") were affixed above the door; they are still in place. Stained-glass windows with nautical themes from the Book of Psalms grace the synagogue.
<P>
The Torah was removed when the Coast Guard left the base in 1996. The last rabbi on the island, William Kloner, a retired U.S. Navy Reserve captain from Brooklyn, took it away. The island's Torah had an interesting military history. Kloner told the <I>Jewish Daily Forward</I> in 2010 that he and the Torah had been at a chapel at Brooklyn's Floyd Bennett Field. Years earlier, a fire raged through the chapel that served the Jewish community on the airfield. A Navy pilot, a Presbyterian, rushed inside to rescue the scrolls. Today the Torah is at Fort Wadsworth, the Staten Island Coast Guard base.
<P>
Since Building S-40 is in the Historic District, it can't be removed, and it's future is uncertain.
