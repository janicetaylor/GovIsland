<P>
After an absence of fourteen years, uniforms returned to Governors Island in 2010: school uniforms. These are the students of the Urban Assembly New York Harbor School, one of the most unique public high schools in the United States. After starting life in Bushwick, Brooklyn, in 2003, the students moved into the renovated Building 550, which was built in 1940 as an Army barracks for 375 men. Today it's capacity is 432 students.
<P>
The Neo-Georgian building the students moved into has a colorful past: After the First Army moved its headquarters to Bristol, England, in 1943, the barracks was turned into office space. In 1966 the Coast Guard converted the building into classrooms for training purposes. About 1994, it was converted once again for use as the base medical clinic (previously located in Building 515). The New York City Department of Education then gutted the building from 2008-2010.
<P>
Harbor School proudly hoisted its school flag on the historic first day of school on Governors Island in September 2010. Students, teachers, and administration joined Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Chancellor Joel Klein and many outside supporters gathered on October 4, 2010, to celebrate the momentous occasion with a "Net Cutting" ceremony. Some features of the new building include: an esturaium in the lobby of the building filled with species only from New York Harbor, an aquaculture lab, library, boat building shop, composting facilities, an outdoor basketball court and garden.
<P>
The school's principles are to provide an education based on excellence, discipline and interdependence; Hands-on, inquiry-based learning in a natural environment stimulates curiosity, critical thinking, and vision, all of which lead to improved academic performance; For students to reach their highest academic standards when given the right opportunities and clear expectations.
<P>
One of the hallmarks of the Harbor School is the oyster, a symbol for the students to embrace. For the city kids, all incoming freshmen must eat one; it's a school tradition. For their next four years, the students work with the oyster as a symbol of environmental growth and development. On the old Yankee Pier, a short walk from the school, the students have their own lab in the water: five oyster reefs that their Aquaculture and SCUBA students installed, maintain, and study (but not eat). Harbor School partnered with 10 other organizations on the Oyster Restoration Research Project.  The school is working with these organizations to bring oysters back to New York Harbor by growing oysters in their spat-on-shell facility and a FLUPSY (Floating Upwelling System) and then transporting them to their reefs. Students learn to sail, SCUBA dive and build a boat at the school.
<P>
Harbor School is also about academics: in 2010, the school celebrated earning its second "A" on its New York City Department of Education report card.
