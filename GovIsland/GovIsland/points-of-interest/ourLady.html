<span class="title">Our Lady, Star of the Sea</span> 

<div id="copy">
Intersection of Clayton Road and Comfort Road<P>

Lieutenant General Hugh A. Drum, post commander from 1938-1940, led the way for the Roman Catholic chapel Our Lady, Star of the Sea to be built on the island in 1942. Prior to the construction, Mass was held in the barracks.
<P>
Beginning in World War I, visiting priests came over to the island from the State Street Mission and St. Peter's Church, 22 Barclay Street, the oldest Roman Catholic parish in New York City. During World War II, the Army erected the structure. The name of the chapel is an ancient title for the Virgin Mary. The words <I>Star of the Sea</I> are a translation of the Latin <I>Stella Maris</I>. The Virgin Mary is believed to intercede as a guide and protector of those who travel or seek their livelihoods on the sea. Mary is the patroness of the Catholic missions to seafarers, and many coastal churches are named Stella Maris or Mary, Star of the Sea.
<P>
Building S-309 is a one-story rectangular frame structure, covered with vinyl siding. The gabled roof is covered with asphalt shingles. A tower at the north end, rising behind the entrance porch, has a copper finial. A brick chimney is at the south end. The window openings have six-over-six sash on the north end; the other window openings on the sides have sixteen-over-sixteen sash set behind storm sash.
<P>
Since the island was opened to the public in 2004, a new use for the chapel has not been found.
