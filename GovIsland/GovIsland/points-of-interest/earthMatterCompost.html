Nearby Picnic Point
<P>
In 2009, the nonprofit Earth Matter NY, a group dedicated to reducing the organic waste misdirected into the garbage stream by encouraging neighbor participation in composting, launched a composting program on Governors Island in collaboration with the Added Value farm and Band of Bicycles.  The groups collected and carted food scraps to the farm by Xtracycle.
<P>
In 2010, Earth Matter NY signed a partnership permit with the Governors Island Preservation and Educational Corporation to operate a compost demonstration site at Picnic Point. The enclosed 35' x 100' space shows the public the many ways to compost at all levels. Earth Matter NY set up collection points around the island for compostable food scraps at all waste collection stations. The demonstration site serves as an important waste reduction tool and an on-site environmental education resource.
<P>
In 2011 Earth Matter found itself in the New York <I>Times</I>, when it received a sign for its new greenhouse. In an usual chain of events, a comedy troupe in the East Village annoyed neighbors with a sign on its Avenue A building reading "Hot Chicks Room," a reference to one of its skits. The sign came down and was given by TV star Amy Poehler to Earth Matter, who were to bring it to Governors Island and hang it on the greenhouse. The new greenhouse will have baby chickens as residents, to teach visitors about waste-reduction and to help create fertile soil for the compost.
