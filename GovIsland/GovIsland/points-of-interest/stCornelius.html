<span class="title">St. Cornelius the Centurion (13)</span> 

<div id="copy">

Corner of Barry Road and Evans Road at the south end of Nolan Park<P>

The Episcopal Chapel of St. Cornelius the Centurion, built in 1906, replaced a 60-year old wood-frame chapel that was the first church on the island. In 1846 the first Chapel of St. Cornelius was dedicated. The patron saint was chosen from the Old Testament's Book of Acts, Chapter 10. The Roman warrior was "a just man and one who feareth God."
<P>
The first chapel was built by the Rev. John McVickar, a professor at Columbia College and an Episcopal clergyman. Dismayed at the lack of a place to worship&#8212services were held in a grove of trees&#8212McVickar worked to secure funding for a chapel, including a large grant from Trinity Church at the foot of Wall Street. He came to the island in 1844 and was its first chaplain, serving for 20 years on the island. It was a small wood-frame chapel that he designed and personally raised the funds to erect.

After six decades of services, a two-story Neo-Gothic church structure, built of coursed white limestone dressed with rusticated rock-face, took its place. It is roughly cruciform in plan (106 feet long and 70 feet at the crossing) with a square, three-story tower at the northwest corner containing the principal entrance. The tower is surmounted by a parapet with four stone turrets. The steeply pitched intersecting gabled roofs are covered with slate and have copper gutters, ridges, and flashing. The architect was Charles C. Haight (1841-1917), who designed many buildings at Yale. The new chapel continued to have an association with Trinity Church, 79 Broadway, in lower Manhattan.
<P>
In 1924, with the expansion of the post on Governors Island, the Army resumed assigning chaplains to Governors Island, while Trinity maintained the chapel. The Coast Guard took over administration of the chapel upon its arrival in 1966.
<P>
In 1986, the Parish of Trinity Church deeded the property to the Coast Guard, with a stipulation stating that the property would revert to Trinity if the Coast Guard vacated the island. When the island opened to the public in 2003, the chapel was closed except for special events such as author talks and book readings. In 2010, the Chautauqua Institution and the World Monuments Fund hosted a lecture program focused on religion, culture, history and architecture in the chapel.
