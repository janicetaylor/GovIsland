<!-- BEGIN DESCRIPTION HERE --> 

<span class="title">Post Hospital (515)</span> 

<div id="copy">

Facing Hay Road, north of Clayton Road<p>
This was the last of four hospitals built on the island. Building 515 is a symmetrically-organized structure, comprising a four-story central section surmounted by slate-covered gabled roof with end chimneys and flanking three-story wings with slate-covered hipped roofs. The red brick walls are laid up in common bond and accented with limestone trim. The slightly projecting three-bay-wide entrance pavilion is articulated by rusticated pilasters and crowned by a triangular pediment with a decorative frieze and an oculis window that appears to retain its original decorative sash. A granite double-staircase with limestone walls leads to a veranda at the second story; the stairs and veranda retain their original wrought-iron railings.
<P>
Building 515 was designed by the office of McKim, Mead & White as the Post Hospital. While not apparent from the exterior, the plan of the building is organized with double-loaded corridors around two interior courts, which would have provided light, air, and cross ventilation for the hospital patients.
<P>
Constructed in 1935, it was part of the unified beautification plan proposed in 1928 for Governors Island by the firm. In the late 1980s the building was converted for use as enlisted mens' housing for the Coast Guard.
