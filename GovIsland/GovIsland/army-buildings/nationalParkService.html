<span class="title">National Park Service (140)</span> 

<div id="copy">

East of the ferry slip, north of Carder Road<p> 
The first building on your left as you walk off the ferry at Soissons Dock is Building 140, a former munitions storehouse built after the Civil War.
<P>
This one-story rectangular structure is constructed of red brick laid in common bond on a brownstone water table. The asphalt-covered gabled roof has wooden eaves and brackets. Large arched entrance openings are set in the east and west ends and in the northern projection. Circular panels at the west end contain relief seals of the War Department and the U.S. Army (both now gilded).
<P>
Building 140, like Building 110 nearby, was built for the New York Arsenal to store obsolete ordnance accumulated after the Civil War. Architecturally, Building 140 remains one of the most distinguished of the arsenal structures. After the Arsenal left the island in 1920, this building was turned over to the Second Corps Area of the Army, which continued to use it as a warehouse. In 1938, under the WPA, a porch was removed from the north facade and the main entrance was oriented to the west. Since then, the building has served a variety of service functions: commissary, bank and post office.
<P>
When the National Park Service moved onto the island to support the National Monument, it took over the building. Today it functions as a bookstore and security office.
