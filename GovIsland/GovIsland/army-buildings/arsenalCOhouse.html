<!-- BEGIN DESCRIPTION HERE --> 

<span class="title">Arsenal Commander's House (135)</span> 

<div id="copy">

Between Andes Road and Carder Road<p>
Building 135, originally constructed as two freestanding buildings, formed the core of the New York Arsenal. The southern section was one of two ordnance storehouses built at the Arsenal about 1835. The northern section was built in 1839 in the Greek Revival style as the quarters for the commanding officer of the Arsenal. A two-story addition for residential and office use was constructed at the south side of the officers' quarters in 1852, abutting the ordnance storehouse. Porches were added at the east, north, and west facades of the residence in 1879. A one-story brick addition was constructed at the southwest corner of the officers' quarters in 1884. These structures retained their original uses until the Arsenal closed in 1920.
<P>
The Army undertook major work on the residence in 1935, enclosing the two-story porch at the west, constructing a two-story, two-bay brick addition behind the 1852 addition, and converting the officers' quarters for the use of two families. The cast-iron decorative work on the porch may also date from this period. The interior has black marble fireplace mantles and the only parquet floor on the island.
