<div id="copy">

Quadrangle Road<p>
The four buildings (202, 206, 210, 214) constructed around the Fort Columbus quadrangle were built in 1834-1836 to house the army garrison, at a time when the military presence on Governors Island was growing. The barracks in the original fort of the 1790s, which survived demolition during its reconstruction in 1806-09, had deteriorated dramatically by the late 1820s.
<P>
A report on Governors Island by the Surgeon General's Office in 1875 described the quadrangle buildings as equipped with basement kitchens for the troops and officers quartered inside the fort. Several two-story triangular buildings at the corners of the barracks housed tailors, married soldiers, a bakery, barbershop, sculleries, and privies. The Historic American Buildings Survey report of 1934 states that at one time there were eight such structures around the quadrangle, five of which have been incorporated into the barracks structures.
<P>
These quarters were in continuous use as housing for officers and enlisted men for more than 160 years. During the Coast Guard era from 1966-1996 these buildings served as family housing. Over the decades, numerous alterations have been made to the interiors to improve the living quarters. The army built the one-story brick automobile garages in 1937-38. A ramp under Building 214 leads to the old Powder Magazine (Building 215), located underground in the north ravelin, used to store explosives and ammunition built 1806-09.
<P>
In 2011 the National Park Service began excavation work underneath the old barracks and quadrangle.    
<P>
These buildings were designated a New York City Landmark in 1967 and a National Historical Landmark in 1972.
