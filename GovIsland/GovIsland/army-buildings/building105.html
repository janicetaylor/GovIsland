<!-- BEGIN DESCRIPTION HERE --> 

<span class="title">Arsenal Armory Office (105)</span> 

<div id="copy">

North of Andes Road, west of Building 104<p>

Building 105 consists of two brick structures joined by a gabled section. The two earliest structures are faced with red brick, laid in common bond, with granite trim and are set on granite bases. This section has a raised stepped roof gable pierced by a lunette. Building 105 was built in several stages for the New York Arsenal.
<P>
The north end was built in 1853 as an armory and office. The south end was built in 1860 as an office, and also housed a museum. The south end was expanded to the west in 1882 and linked to the north end at the same time. After the Arsenal closed in 1920, the building was turned over to the Second Corps Area of the Army, which expanded it further in 1940. It has remained in use as offices.
