<span class="title">Soissons Dock (142)</span> 

<div id="copy">

The ferries between Governors Island and the Battery Maritime Building in lower Manhattan operate from Soissons Dock, a location for ferry service that dates to the 19th Century. The present ferry slip structures were built in 1947. Permanent Army-operated ferry service was established between Governors Island and Manhattan during the tenure of General Winfield Scott Hancock in the 1860s.
<P>
Following World War I, this landing was named Soissons Dock in commemoration of the preparations of the 16th Regiment for an attack on German forces near Soissons, France, on July 18, 1918. The regiment suffered 1,734 casualties, 57 percent of its total strength. A commemorative plaque is placed on the ferry waiting room.
<P>
During World War II, ferries ran every 15 minutes to Manhattan and back. Today the ferry runs to Manhattan's Battery Maritime Building.
