<div id="copy">

North of Andes Road, west of the ferry slip<p>
Ulysses S. Grant served as the 18th President from 1869 to 1877&#8212the same time period Building 110 was constructed&#8212but this building has been given a whole other life as the island's center for cutting-edge artists that would be alien in President Grant's era.
<P>
It is a 2 &#189-story rectangular red brick structure with a shallow gable roof covered with asphalt roll-roofing. Large brick pilasters mark the bay divisions. The main entrance at the east end of the building is set in an elliptical brick arch. The first story on the south side of the building fronts an areaway well, but the two stories on the north side are completely exposed.
<P>
Building 110, first proposed in 1870 and constructed prior to 1879, was constructed for the New York Arsenal to store obsolete arms from the Civil War that had been accumulated for sale on the New York market. The building was constructed against the slope of the hill rising up to the fort. From the 1880s to World War I, the Quartermaster Department had offices in the building. In World War II the Army used it as a bank and post office. After the Coast Guard left, the 14,000-square-foot space was utilized for a variety of purposes.
<P>
In 2008 the future master plans of the island were displayed in Building 110. The interior was then gutted and the interior taken to raw space. In 2010 the former arsenal storehouse began a new life. The Governors Island Preservation and Education Corporation awarded a five-year commitment to the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council's (LMCC) Artist Studios Program. With designs by Davis Brody Bond Aedas, a unique space was carved out of the 140-year-old structure. It was transformed into 20 visual arts studios, exhibition space and offices. It allows for workspace for more than 30 visual and performance artists. Each studio is about 400 square feet and features movable walls. The LMCC selects the artists through a juried process. Each earns a five-month residency. During the summer visitor season, the studios are open to the public during selected times to view the work created on Governors Island.
<P>
The LMCC Arts Center schedule for Building 110 is on its <A HREF="http://www.lmcc.net" TAGRET="NEW">web site</A>. It is open to the public whenever the island is open Friday-Sunday.
