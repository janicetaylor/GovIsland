<!-- BEGIN DESCRIPTION HERE --> 

<span class="title">Fort Jay Gatehouse (201)</span> 

<div id="copy">

Quadrangle Road<p>
Inside the walls of Fort Jay is a monumental gateway of brownstone with paired piers supporting an entablature and flanking an arch. Inside the entrance, a small one-story brick structure (also identified as Building 201) on a red sandstone base is set behind the upper portion of the gate. It was originally used as a guardhouse. The chains at the entrance are the remains of a drawbridge, which once spanned the moat, which was drained many years ago.
<P>
The walls of the vault leading into the interior quadrangle through and under Building 202 are lined with brick above a granite base. In the early 19th Century a sunken passageway connected Fort Jay to Castle Williams; it is part of the long-term plans of the National Park Service to restore such a roadway. The old doorway is still visible inside the fort.
<P>
Above the gateway is a 15-foot tall sandstone sculpture, a trophy tableau with a large bald eagle and military symbols such as flags, mortar, cannon and shield. Island legend says the sculptor was a prisoner who had been a stonecutter before he'd joined the Army, and that his work earned his release after he carved the sculpture over the Fort Jay gateway. As the tale is told, the young daughter of the post commander was walking beneath the entranceway as the stonecutter was at work. A large chunk of stone broke loose, and would have crushed the child, but the prisoner pushed her away and let the stone land on him instead, saving her life but causing him severe injuries. The act earned him a full pardon and he was able to leave Governors Island.
<P>
The gatehouse was designated a New York City Landmark in 1967 and a National Historical Landmark in 1972.
