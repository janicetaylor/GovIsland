Hilltop site north of Andes Road<p> 
Pershing Hall is a rectangular three-story brick structure set on a brick foundation built in 1934. The red brick facades are laid up in Flemish bond. The gabled roof is covered with slate and punctuated by glass hatchway covers. Two tall brick chimneys rise from the roof. The two major facades are not identical. The south facade, oriented towards the New York Arsenal buildings, has a first-story entrance (now converted to a window) set in a limestone surround and flanked by semi-circular granite stairs set on a brick base with wrought-iron railings.

The interior of Building 125 has large, beautiful murals on the walls. During the 1930s, many Governors Island buildings were updated or expanded as part of the Works Progress Administration, and Pershing Hall benefited from a Federal Arts Project commission. Major Tom L. Johnson (1905-1964), a Yale graduate who trained at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, came to Pershing Hall and completed murals for Building 125's principal hallways. Johnson's 90-foot mural depicts almost 150 years of American military history.

The architect of Pershing Hall was a former World War I Army private, Lorimer Rich (1891-1978).  Rich's most-famous work is the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington National Cemetery. Initially Building 125 was to be the headquarters and administrative offices of the Second Corps Area, a subset of the First Army. Major General Dennis E. Nolan (1872-1956) was the commander of the Second Corps Area as well as the commander of the First Army, so when the building opened it served both staffs. The First Army played a major role in preparation for the war in Europe and took part in Operation Overlord, the invasion of Normandy in June 1944. After the war, the First Army command returned to Governors Island in 1946, remaining there until 1966.

Building 125 was dedicated as Pershing Hall on August 10, 1954, in honor of General John J. Pershing (1860-1948), commander of the American Expeditionary Forces in World War I. Pershing sailed from Fort Jay in May 1917 for France, where he oversaw all American military participation with the Allies. When the Coast Guard took over Governors Island in 1966, the building served as headquarters for the Third District.

Today, the building is used for a wide variety of events that require large meeting rooms, from speaking engagements, book lectures, and movie screenings. The Long Island Writer's Guild presented original stories and poetry at a 2008 event in Pershing Hall. In 2009 the African Film Institute screened short films in the building; one of many visual arts organizations to utilize the former military spaces. In 2010 the Sundance Institute, the nation's leading independent film incubator, funded actors, screenwriters and directors to spend 12 days in Pershing Hall to conduct workshops and filmmaking studies.
