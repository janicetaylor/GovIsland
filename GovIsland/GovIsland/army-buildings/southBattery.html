<span class="title">South Battery (298)</span> 

<div id="copy">

South of the Parade Ground<p>
The South Battery, or Half-Moon Battery, was constructed just prior to the War of 1812 to guard the entrance to Buttermilk Channel, which separates the island from Brooklyn. Located at the old southeast tip of Governors Island, the fort is constructed of red sandstone, had an arrow-head shape and 13 cannon mounted <I>en barbette</I>, i.e., on an open parapet.
<P>
The South Battery was the third component of the fortification of Governors Island, along with its counterparts, Fort Jay and Castle Williams. Its construction is attributed to Lt. Col. Jonathan Williams and built around 1811. The South Battery was a solid masonry structure, in keeping with the objectives of the Second American System. When changes in military technology rendered the building obsolete as a fort, Building 298 was adapted to many other uses over the decades.
<P>
In 1836 the Field Music Department moved into the South Battery. These 50 drummers and pipers, all young boys, were nicknamed the "Music Boys" by the soldiers. It was here that the army trained the musicians who would accompany the infantry into scores of battles in the American Civil War. The musician's barracks became an informal grill room when the building became the Officers' Club in 1879.
<P>
In the 1840s, a one-story barracks building with a gable roof was constructed within the battery. Prior to 1863, a second story was added. Building 298 served as barracks for non-commissioned staff until 1878, when it was converted to an officers' mess hall; it also served as a temporary Catholic chapel. In the mid-1880s court martial rooms were located here.
<P>
A major remodeling project in 1904 converted the South Battery to an amusement hall and lecture room for enlisted men. The WPA rebuilt the second floor as Corbin Hall in 1936-37. By 1939 the building was in use as the Governors Island Officers' Club. When the Coast Guard moved in, the building remained for officers' use.
