<!-- BEGIN DESCRIPTION HERE --> 

<span class="title">Marshall Hall (108)</span> 

<div id="copy">

Northeast of Andes Road, south of Carder Road<p>
Building 108 is an L-shaped two-story structure, constructed of brick laid up in a five-course American bond on a brick basement set on a concrete slab. The intersecting gabled roof is covered with asphalt shingles. A raking wood cornice outlines the roof. The main entrance is located at the west end of the south elevation and has a wood surround consisting of Tuscan columns supporting a flat entablature. The cornerstone at the west end reads "Erected A.D. 1945." Building 108 was built to contain offices for the First Army; it has remained in use as offices for nearly 70 years.
<P>
Named Marshall Hall for General George C. Marshall (1880-1959), the army chief of staff in World War II and President Harry S. Truman's secretary of state and secretary of defense. He was the chief military adviser to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. His name was given to the plan to rebuild Post-war Europe, for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1953.
