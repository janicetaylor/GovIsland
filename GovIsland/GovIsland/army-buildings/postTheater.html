<!-- BEGIN DESCRIPTION HERE --> 

<span class="title">Post Theater (330)</span> 

<div id="copy">
Facing Owasco Road, north of Cartigan Road<p>
Constructed in 1937, Building 330 is a two-story theater building on a concrete foundation faced with reddish-brown brick laid in American bond. The main block of the building has brick quoins at the corners and a slate-covered hipped roof. On the north side is a two-story gabled projection above the entrance portico. This projection has three blind arches with cast stone keystones and impost blocks, brick quoins, and a raking wood cornice outlining the gable. A projecting wing with a hipped roof has been added at the south end of the building.
<P>
This theater design, with a rectangular plan and neo-Georgian detail, was typical of those constructed on military bases during this period. It has continued to be used for the showing of films and as an auditorium.
<P>
In 1995, the theater was used for the annoucement that the Coast Guard was departing Governors Island.
