<span class="title">The Block House (9)</span> 

<div id="copy">

Facing Nolan Park, northwest of Barry Road<p>
The Block House is one of the oldest buildings on the island; it has served as a hospital, headquarters and housing. Facing Nolan Park, the Block House, while stylistically different from the wood-frame houses that surround it and dominate the park, contributes to the area in scale and 19th Century character. The Block House was built as the post hospital to serve the Fort Columbus garrison.
<P>
Built in 1839 in the Greek Revival style, like several of the island's Arsenal buildings of the same era, Building 9 exhibits an austerity in plan and detailing, which prompted its popular name, the Block House. The building's interior has been altered a number of times to accommodate changes in its use. It served as the post hospital until 1878. A yellow fever epidemic swept Governors Island in 1870, and the entire island was placed under quarantine. In 1874, due to poor ventilation in the original building, two large wings to serve as patient wards were built onto the rear, reaching almost to the seawall.
<P>
The building was subsequently used for disciplinary hearings, military trials, recruit exams, lectures, and balls. By 1878 when the Military Division of the Atlantic was transferred to the island, it deemed the building "unsuited for the purpose of a Hospital."  For the next several decades, Building 9 was used as a headquarters through several different Army commands. After World War II, the Army converted the Block House to four apartments for officers' housing.
<P>
The Block House was designated a New York City Landmark in 1967 and a National Historical Landmark in 1972.
