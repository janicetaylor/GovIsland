Quadrangle Road<p>
In the first few years of the 19th Century, the United States instigated a large-scale campaign to fortify its coastal regions against naval attack, in light of probable war with Great Britain. For the Second American System of fortifications, as this effort was called, Governors Island (which had been ceded to the federal government by New York in 1800) was considered a key strategic location for protecting New York Harbor from an enemy invasion. By the time of the War of 1812, the island was home to some of the most advanced and powerful defenses in the nation. It is widely believed by military historians that New York was spared attack by the British in 1812 because of these strong deterrents in New York Harbor.
<P>
The fortifications were the first to be supervised by Americans; prior to that French engineers had been used to build American forts. Lt. Col. Jonathan Williams was familiar with French fort engineering, and was placed in charge of the defense of New York Harbor. 
<P>
Fort Jay is located near the center of the island with clear views across the East River and the Buttermilk Channel. It was named for New York native John Jay (1745-1829), one of the Founding Fathers and the first chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Originally a large earthen fort completed in 1796, it was typical of others along the coast in its design. Because of inadequate funding by the government, the first fort was completed in large part by volunteers from New York City's trade societies and colleges. A tablet at the Fort Jay entrance given to the fort in 1952 by alumni of Columbia University commemorates these efforts, as "The best tradition of free men," since many of the early contributors of labor was college students and professors from the school.
<P>
The U.S. Army took over Governors Island in 1800. The fort reconstruction campaign began in 1806, and the square, four-bastioned shape and portions of the earlier fort were retained, enlarged, and improved. The walled counterscarp, gate, sally port, magazine, and two barracks were salvaged. The shape remained the same on the west, south, and east sides, and an additional 14 feet were added to each. When completed in 1811, it was capable of mounting 104 guns. The outer pentagonal parapet of earth was backed with brick (much of the brick was replaced in the 1940s and 1990s), and four masonry bastions in the interior. Ninety-six guns were put in place and they could sweep the whole landscape around the entire harbor. Inside the fort, walls were extended for barracks for 1,000 soldiers. The army built kitchens and installed a pump to bring up fresh water. The quadrangle was used to drill troops, surrounded by four barracks structures (Buildings 202, 206, 210, 214). During the Coast Guard era the barracks were converted to family housing and the quadrangle became a children's playground. 
<P>
Fort Jay is surrounded by a nearly intact grass and dirt glacis (a kind of berm). The fort is sunken to allow the glacis to cover the walls up to the base of the fort's parapet and then slope down and away from the fort on all sides. The fort is a masonry structure with four bastions enclosed by a dry moat. The moat walls are constructed of red sandstone laid up in a range-coursed ashlars pattern, topped by one course of bluestone. 
<P>
John Jay, for whom the fort had been named, fell out of favor with the public due to his treaty negotiations with the British while trying to stop the War of 1812. In 1810 the fort was renamed Fort Columbus. In 1904, U.S. Secretary of War Elihu Root reinstated the name Fort Jay. When the National Park Service took over management of Fort Jay in 2001, it began an ambitions plan to stabilize the fort and prepare a long-term preservation plan. During the summer months NPS rangers lead tours of the fort.
<P>
Fort Jay was designated a New York City Landmark in 1967 and a National Historical Landmark in 1972.
