<!-- BEGIN DESCRIPTION HERE --> 

<span class="title">Gun Carriage Storehouse (107)</span> 

<div id="copy">

East of Andes Road, northwest of Building 105<p> 
Building 107 is a one-story rectangular red brick structure set on a bluestone rubble foundation on the west and a concrete foundation on the east. The double gable roof (each section has its own gable) is covered with asphalt shingles. A brick chimney is at the north side. The unpretentious main entrance faces east and has a splayed brick arch with keystone and is flanked by brick pilasters. The brick entry porch at the north end dates from about 1980. The western section of Building 107 was built in 1856-57 as a storage shed for gun carriages.
<P>
This was the fourth storehouse to be constructed for the New York Arsenal on Governors Island. The building burned in 1904 and was rebuilt. It was then doubled in size between 1908 and 1918 when the eastern section was constructed. A brick addition was built at the southwest corner at that time. When the Arsenal closed in 1920, the building was turned over to the Second Corps Area of the Army, which continued to use it for storage. An addition was made at the southeast corner in 1940, when the building was converted for office space.
