<!-- BEGIN DESCRIPTION HERE --> 

<span class="title">Tampa Memorial Library (S-251)</span> 

<div id="copy">

Corner of Andes Road and Tampa Road<p> 
Building S-251 is a rectangular one-story wood frame structure set on a high brick basement. It was built about 1908 to serve the needs of the Fort Jay Quartermaster for storage and as a workshop. During World War I it was used for supplies and during World War II it was the post exchange (PX), selling everything from cigarettes to soap.
<P>
During the Coast Guard era, the structure became the post library and was named the Tampa Memorial Library, to commemorate the sinking of the USCGC <I>Tampa</I>. A German U-boat attacked and sunk the <I>Tampa</I> on Sept. 26, 1918, resulting in the highest U.S. combat casualty loss in World War I. The cutter sank with all hands, 115 officers and men, and 16 passengers.
<P>
Building S-251 served as the post library for many years. When the Coast Guard departed in 1997, the book-return box was left standing in front of the entrance. The short street west of the library was also named in honor of the <I>Tampa</I>. The building lies within the boundaries of the National Monument; the decision is up to the National Park Service to determine its fate.
