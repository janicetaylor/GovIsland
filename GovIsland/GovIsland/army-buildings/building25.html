<span class="title">Ordnance Storehouse (25)</span> 

<div id="copy">

South of Andes Road<p>
The ordnance storehouse located at the north end of Nolan Park, is a long narrow rectangular structure, approximately 180 feet long and 30 feet wide, attributed to Lt. Col. Jonathan Williams and built in 1811. It is two stories high on the south side, and three stories on the north side, accommodating the slope which leads to the waterfront. The walls are brick laid in Flemish bond in the western section and common bond in the eastern section. At the second story on the Nolan Park front is a cantilevered wood frame addition, covered with wood clapboards and supported by square columns.
<P>
Building 25 is one of the oldest surviving buildings from the rebuilding of Fort Jay as Fort Columbus. Built for ordnance storage, it was situated south of the main road which led to the wharf. Since its original construction, the building has been enlarged and adapted for many uses, perhaps most notably as the first office of the post commander in 1878 after the Headquarters of the Military Division of the Atlantic and the Department of the East was transferred to Fort Columbus. The initial enlargement of the structure seems to coincide with this use. In the 19th Century it served as a museum, a school and a recreation hall.
<P>
Although altered many times, the building still retains its historic character. During World War II it housed the post telephone operations. During the Coast Guard era it was used for offices.
