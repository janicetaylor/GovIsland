<span class="title">Quick Island Overview</span> 

<div id="copy">

Governors Island was a military base until it closed in 1997. It opened to the public in 2004. The Trust For Governors Island and the National Park Service manage the island. It is only open Friday-Sunday from May to September. Free ferry service to the island is available from Manhattan and Brooklyn. The island is 172 acres and only 800 yards from Manhattan, and even closer to Brooklyn. Visitors can see historic military sites, view temporary art installations, bicycle over more than five miles of car-free roadways, enjoy live music, and picnic within view of the Statue of Liberty.
