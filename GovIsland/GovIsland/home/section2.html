<span class="title">What is Governors Island?</span> 

<div id="copy">

There are close to 20 million people in the New York metropolitan area, but only a tiny fraction have ever been to the 172-acre island that lies within a golf stroke of Brooklyn. This is Governors Island, the green jewel that's next to a ventilation shaft of the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel, the collection of buildings and trees that 12 million tourists pass annually on their way to the Statue of Liberty. Governors Island was a military base, closed to the public, from the era that spanned from 2nd President John Adams to 43rd President George W. Bush.
<P>
In 2004 a trickle of 4,000 were the first pioneering visitors to explore the buildings left behind by the U.S. Army and the U.S. Coast Guard. But Governors Island is more than three old forts and empty officers' housing. Unlike Central Park and Prospect Park, cars are banned. There are five miles of roadways to bicycle. It has open spaces. And unlike those other parks, it has water views, spectacular vistas of New York Harbor, Brooklyn, Manhattan and New Jersey. The future of this unique park is still being written, and visiting it now is a thrilling experience.
