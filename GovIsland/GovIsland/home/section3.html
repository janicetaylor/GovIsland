<span class="title">About the Explorer's Guide</span> 

<div id="copy">

The Governors Island Explorer's Guide was created for visitors to the island to learn more about its history and to get the most out of a visit. The island only opened to the public in 2004 and there is very little information easily available about the history, amenities, and visitor information needed to enjoy a visit. The park is currently in transition as it enters the next phase of its development, so this guide was created to help visitors understand the 200 years of Governors Island history, as well as help those who just want to come out and enjoy a nice bike ride. The Governors Island Explorer's Guide was developed over five years of visits to the island, along with research into government publications, city history books, historic newspaper files, and institutional research.
