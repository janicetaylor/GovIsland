<!-- BEGIN DESCRIPTION HERE --> 

<span class="title">1878 Officers' Quarters (6)</span> 

<div id="copy">

Facing Nolan Park, west of Barry Road
<P>
Building 6, built as one of a pair with Building 7, was constructed in 1878 as company officers' housing during the year that Fort Columbus became the Headquarters of the Military Division of the Atlantic and the Department of the East, a change in status which gave rise to an increased demand for officers' housing. Victorian vernacular in design and facing The Green (Nolan Park), it followed the form of Buildings 4 and 5, and it was joined by eight other units (Buildings 7, 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18) built that same year. While some additions have been made to the house, it retains its 19th Century character, especially with the restoration of the clapboard siding and open front porch in recent years.
<P>
In 2010 the home found a new use as a "pop up" bricks-and-mortar location for 30 artists from thenewnewny.com to sell their own handmade jewelry, clothing, toys, home decor, and paper goods.
