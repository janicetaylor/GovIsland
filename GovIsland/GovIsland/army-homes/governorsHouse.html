<span class="title">Governor's House (2)</span> 

<div id="copy">
Facing Nolan Park, corner of Barry Road and Andes Road
<P>
This is called the Governor's House, but it was never occupied by any Dutch or English governors. Building 2 is the oldest structure on Governors Island besides the fortifications. Built during the War of 1812 and clearly visible on an 1813 map, this two-story brick house of simple Georgian design is not the colonial governor's mansion, as is often claimed. It was constructed as a guard house and is the oldest extant structure on the island outside Fort Jay and Castle Williams. From 1824 to 1843 the building served as quarters for the commanding officer and between 1843 and into the 20th Century, it housed the offices of the post commanding officer. At least by 1922, the building had been converted to officers' quarters, probably for the post commander. 
<P>
The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. According to Historic American Buildings Survey documentation, it was built as the main guard house, and was probably constructed by troops stationed on the island or by local civilians. Building 2 has been altered numerous times. By 1839 its roof had been changed to a combination hipped and gabled roof, and the original two-story portico had been replaced by one-story porches on each floor. By mid-century it appears to have reverted back to a guardhouse, at least in some capacity; an 1863 inspection report lists the post guard house in its basement. The building continued to be used as a guardhouse until 1908 when it became post headquarters. 
<P>
In the early 1920s, Building 2 was converted back into a residence for a general officer. Extensive alterations were made in the 1930s, as part of the work by the WPA. Most notably, its original cross form was largely obscured by a one-story addition, which wraps around the north and east sides of the house. From 1966-1996 it served as housing for the Coast Guard's base commander.
<P>
When Governors Island became a national landmark in 1985, it was believed that Building 2 was once the home of colonial governor Edward Hyde, 3rd Earl of Clarendon (1661-1723), known as Vicount Cornbury, an attribution that has since been repudiated. This conclusion was based on an inspection report of 1863 which gave a construction date of 1811; and an 1813 plan of the island drawn by Joseph Mangin showing a two-story, cross-shaped building with intersecting gabled roofs on this site. 
<P>
Note that there are two bronze plaques on the exterior, one from the Society of Colonial Wars in the State of New York in 1951; a second from the New York Community Trust in 1976; both are grossly historically inaccurate.
