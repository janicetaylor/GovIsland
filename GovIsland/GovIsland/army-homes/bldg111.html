<P>
To meet the needs of families moving to the post in the 1930s, the Army put up new apartment-style buildings facing New York Harbor. Designed by New York architects Rogers & Poor, Building 111 is a 3&#189 story L-shaped structure with brick facing laid in Flemish bond set on a limestone basement with a graceful rolled molding. Each section of the "L" has a slate-covered roof punctuated by triangular dormers and prominent end chimneys. The main entrances on the east and south sides have prominent limestone surrounds with a broken pediment on the south and a triangular pediment on the east. Cast-iron lamps are placed on the pilasters. Within each limestone surround is a wood surround with wood panels and an eagle-adorned transom. The courtyard side of the building is accented by three prominent projecting two-story bays of wood surmounted by parapets with Greek key motifs. The entrance bay on the south side is distinguished by a large arched opening above the entranceway and a triangular pediment surmounted by an eagle intersecting the roof. A wood entablature with dentils and a guttae motif above the entrance bay sets off the roofline.
<P>
Building 111 was constructed in 1934 with its mirror image, Building 112, to accommodate officers of the 16th Infantry and their family members. These buildings were an outgrowth of the plan by the Office of McKim, Mead & White for expanded facilities on Governors Island. The neo-Georgian style is consistent with other contemporary buildings on the island and is one that was very popular on military bases during the period.
