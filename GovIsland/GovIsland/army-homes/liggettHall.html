<P>
The Interwar Period saw the final major building campaign on Governors Island. More than a dozen structures went up within the historic district during this period to replace temporary structures from World War I. Many of these pre-World War II buildings are located on the landfill adjacent to the edge of the original shoreline, in a symmetrical arrangement across the center of the island. Work began in 1928 on the "model barracks" that would become Liggett Hall (originally named Building 100).  In 1928 the Army won an appropriation of $1.1 million for construction of the building. After 20 years of flimsy temporary Army barracks, this was the first permanent structure built entirely on the landfill, and because of insecurity over the landfill's stability, the foundations of Liggett Hall rests on piles set into bedrock in the harbor. 
<P>
The new barracks building was designed in the neo-Georgian style by the acclaimed firm of McKim, Mead & White; the architects responsible for more than 50 landmarks in New York, among them the Washington Arch in Washington Square Park (1892) and the James A. Farley Post Office (1913) on Eighth Avenue. The design of Liggett Hall was in keeping with the Army's housing policy of the era: improved efficiency and esprit de corps by housing an entire regiment under one roof. Building 400 is U-shaped in plan, facing the officers' quarters on Regimental Row (Brick Row). The building forms three sides of a quadrangle, broken by a monumental, arched sally port, spanning Early Bird Road. The structure is faced with red brick laid in common bond interrupted by header courses, set on a concrete foundation. The 4&#189-story central section has a steeply pitched slate-covered gabled roof with large chimneys, crowned by a cupola surmounted by a copper weather vane. The cupola is easily visible from Manhattan.
<P>
The 16th Infantry moved into the barracks in 1930. It remains one of the largest military buildings in the world, more than 1,000 feet long with two 225-foot wings at each end. While Building 400 introduced an unprecedented scale to the island's mix of buildings, it reflected the island's historic associations through its materials, its skillful articulation of detail, and its architectural references to Fort Jay. In particular, its monumental archway echoes&#8212and is on an axis with&#8212Fort Jay's own sally port. 
<P>
This model barracks was built to house the 1,375 men of the 16th Infantry Regiment, which was headquartered on the island between the World Wars. Building 400 also separates the island's historic area from its landfill portion and post World War II construction. Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, as part of his long crusade for an airfield on Governors Island, accused the Army of constructing Building 400 across the island to thwart his plans. In 1957, Building 400 was named Liggett Hall by the Army to honor First Army Commander Lieutenant General Hunter Liggett (1857-1935). General Liggett spent more than four decades in uniform; his service spanned the Indian Wars to World War I.
<P>
In 1959 the structure was revamped to house 807 men in peacetime. A series of alterations in the 1960s and early 1970s were conducted by the Coast Guard to upgrade living conditions in the building, including the addition of two new wings and closing portions of the first-story arcade.
<P>
As Governors Island transitions from military base to public park, Liggett Hall will be the landmark building that faces the new park space. There are plans to tear out the parking lots and plant a garden in what will be called Liggett Terrace.
