<!-- BEGIN DESCRIPTION HERE --> 

<span class="title">The Dutch House (3)</span> 

<div id="copy">
Facing Nolan Park, west of Barry Road
<P>
Building 3 is a two-story building constructed of brown brick laid up in common bond above a schist foundation. The north and south walls have stepped end gables, and the gable roof is covered with asphalt shingles. It was built in 1846 as a commissary storehouse and a quartermaster storehouse to solve the problem of goods storage on the Fort Columbus post. Oriented to the north when constructed, it had large window and door openings on that side to allow for the movement of supplies in and out of the building. The interior was an open unobstructed space typical of warehouse facilities. Following World War I when the needs of the army installation were changing, the building was reoriented towards Nolan Park and converted to officers' housing and the interior divided to be used for two families.
<P>
Because of the stepped end gables, which are original to the building, it has been dubbed the Dutch House
