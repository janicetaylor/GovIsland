<div id="copy">

Facing Nolan Park and Barry Road<p>

Constructed in 1843 as the Commanding Officer's Quarters, this large, brick, two-story house which faces west on Nolan Park was designed by prominent New York architect Martin E. Thompson (1786-1877).  Originally the house had the character of a country villa with some unusual exterior woodwork, scalloped trim along the roof cornice, and porch columns of latticework. It served as the residence of the post commander from 1843 to 1997.

Building 1 is set on a high basement on the east side to accommodate the slope of the site. Rectangular in form with a rectangular wing at the southeast corner, it is constructed of brick laid up in common bond with brownstone belt courses, window lintels, and sills. The basement is stone under the main section of the house and brick under the wing. Building 1 is one of the few structures on Governors Island that has had a single continuous use.  (Prior to 1843, Building 2, originally a guard house, had been used as quarters for the Commanding Officer.)

<P>
The building's intended use as a residence for a general and his family may have influenced the Army's choice of a distinguished architect. Renowned for his work in the Greek revival style, by the 1840s Martin E. Thompson was well-established in New York. Another significant Thompson commission, The Arsenal (1847) on Fifth Avenue and East 64th Street in Central Park, is used today as the offices of the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. 
<P>
Thompson's Greek revival design was modified with the addition of a wing at the southwest corner of the house in 1886. Sometime between 1893 and 1918, a second substantial alteration took place: the west facade porch was altered to replace the lattice-like supporting posts with Tuscan columns; a balustrade was placed on top of the porch roof; and the front and rear roof slopes were raised, creating wide verandas and giving the house a more Colonial Revival appearance. In 1936 as part of the WPA work on the island, Building 1 underwent a major renovation. Charles O. Cornelius, a specialist in early American architecture, removed the peak roof, redesigned the whole rear of the house, replacing wooden porch elements with brick, and embellished the porches with ironwork, both front and rear.
<P>
Building 1 has been home to a number of important men, including Winfield Scott Hancock, Adna R. Chaffee, Leonard Wood, Robert L. Bullar, and Dennis E. Nolan. Tablets in the interior entrance list the names of the former occupants. In 1988 the final summit meeting between President Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev, General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, took place in the house.
