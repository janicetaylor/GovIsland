<span class="title">1917 Officers' Quarters (410)</span> 

<div id="copy">

Hay Road, South of Comfort Road
<P>
Constructed in 1917 in the Modified Arts and Crafts style, Building 410 is a two-story double house, faced in brown brick laid in common bond and set on brick basement marked by a soldier course band. The rectangular structure has an asphalt-covered hipped roof with wide eaves and end chimneys. A screened entrance porch has brick posts supporting a shallow hipped roof with flared eave brackets. Small, enclosed utility porches have been added at the rear.
<P>
Building 410 was the last dwelling to be constructed on Regimental Row facing Hay Road. By that time the new landfill would have been completed. Although designed as a double unit, it is smaller in size and scale than the other double units to the south. It also differs from them in the color of the brick and in the form of the roof. Although designed according to a standardized Quartermaster plan, it is the only house of its type on Governors Island.
