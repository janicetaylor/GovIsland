<span class="title">1931 NCO Family Quarters (12)</span> 

<div id="copy">

East of Barry Road, facing Kimmel Road
<P>
This 1931 building faces Brooklyn and stretches along the Buttermilk Chanel. Building 12 is a Neo-Georgian brick-faced structure on a concrete foundation composed of fifteen sections, detailed and organized in such a way as to break up the building's bulk. Seven sections form a reverse U fronting a courtyard facing the water. Three sections extend to the west of the U and five sections extend to the east.
<P>
The red brick facing is laid in common bond interrupted by rows of header courses above a high limestone base terminating in a molding.
<P>
Building 12 was the first housing for soldiers and their dependents constructed in accordance with the unified beautification plan for Governors Island by the Office of McKim, Mead & White of 1928. Similar in style to Liggett Hall, it was carried out by the Office of the Quartermaster General and set the pattern for later family housing on the island. In World War II, the Korean War and during the Vietnam era, Building 12 was housing for Army noncommissioned officers (corporals and above) and warrant officers, and their families. During the Coast Guard era it remained as enlisted housing.
<P>
In 2010, the Third Annual Governors Island Art Fair used the building for a completely different purpose. More than 100 artists showed off their work in Building 12. Each artist was given a room to display their work inside. The public was invited to view the art by browsing from room to room.
