<span class="title">1894 Officers' Quarters (407)</span> 

<div id="copy">

Hay Road, South of Comfort Road
<P>
Constructed in 1894 in the Romanesque Revival style, Building 407 is a 2&#189 story double house faced with red pressed brick and set on a foundation of schist. A gabled front section projects from the gabled-roof main block of the house. Two hipped-roof wings project from the rear of the house. Hipped-roof dormers with paired windows project from the main roof slope. The north entrance porch has slender wood columns supporting a shallow hipped roof covered with a standing seam metal roof. Wooden balustrades with turned posts link the columns. Raking wood cornices outline the gable ends with denticulation below the gable pediments, and wood cornices set off the main roof slopes.
<P>
Building 407 was built as one of a group of six brick houses facing the old southwestern shoreline of Governors Island, now approximately the line of Hay Road. This group, designed according to standardized Quartermaster General plans, incorporated five double sets (Buildings 404, 405, 406, 407 and 408) of officers' housing as well as a single-unit dwelling (Building 403). The houses share general forms and material, although the details vary slightly with the construction dates. Buildings 407 and 408 were the second two houses to be constructed.
