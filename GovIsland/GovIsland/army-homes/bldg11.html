South end of Nolan Park, north of Barry Road
<P>
This small house had a distinguished early resident. The Army service of David "Doc" Robertson from 1854 to 1918 is an incredible story of a man who treated soldiers from the Civil War to World War I, spanning more than 60 years on Governors Island. He enlisted at 21 and spent his entire career on the island. A medic, druggist and nurse, he earned the sobriquet "doctor" for treating the soldiers and their families for 64 years. Doc Robertson's wife, Mary Moore, was the daughter of the Music School director. They resided in Building 25, northeast of the chapel. She tended a garden that was famously beautiful. In 1878, the Army built this house for the couple when Robertson was the post hospital steward, when the hospital was in The Block House (Building 9).
<P>
Building 11 is a one-family, one-story house, of wood frame construction set on a high brick basement. Rectangular in plan, it has walls covered with tongue-and-groove siding and a shallow gabled roof covered with asphalt shingles. In the 1930s it was converted for noncommissioned officers' quarters and an addition was placed on the north side. It has remained in use as single-family housing.
<P>
The 19th Century character of the building has been enhanced by the restoration of the wooden siding and the open porch in recent years.
