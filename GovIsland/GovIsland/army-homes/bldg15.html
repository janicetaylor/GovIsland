<!-- BEGIN DESCRIPTION HERE --> 

<span class="title">1879 Officers' Quarters (15)</span> 

<div id="copy">

Facing Nolan Park, east of Evans Road
<P>
Building 15 is a one-family, two-story house, of wood frame construction in the Victorian vernacular style, set on a brick foundation. L-shaped in plan, it has clapboard-covered walls and a gabled roof covered with asphalt shingles and penetrated by gabled projections rising above the second story windows at the front and double end chimneys. A full-width porch with a shallow hipped roof supported by square posts and with decorative scrollwork brackets and balustrades extends across the east facade. One story has been added at the end of the "L," and a garage has been attached.
<P>
Building 15, built as one of a group of five houses, was constructed in 1878-79 as company officers' housing during the year that Fort Columbus became the Headquarters of the Military Division of the Atlantic and the Department of the East, a change in status which gave rise to an increased demand for officers' housing. Facing east onto The Green (Nolan Park), it followed the form of Buildings 4 and 5, and it was joined by eight other units (Buildings 6, 7, 8, 10, 14, 16, 17 and 18) built that same year. It retains its 19th Century character, especially with the restoration of the clapboard siding, quarter-sawn wood trim, and open front porch in recent years.
