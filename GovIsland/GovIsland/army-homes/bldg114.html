<!-- BEGIN DESCRIPTION HERE --> 

<span class="title">Fort Jay Nurses' Quarters (114)</span> 

<div id="copy">
Across from Castle Williams, between Carder Road and Andes Road
<P>
The third Neo-Georgian quarters on Andes Road is Building 114, a rectangular brick structure with a 2&#189 story central pavilion flanked by two-story wings. The red brick facing is laid in Flemish bond rising from a limestone base with a rolled molding. The entrances, located on the east and west elevations differ because of the slope on which the building is situated. The east entrance has an arched limestone pediment and is approached by granite steps. A wood cornice sets off the roofline.
<P>
Building 114 was constructed in 1934 to house the Fort Jay nurses' quarters. The hospital, now Building 515, was located nearby. The architects, Rogers & Poor, repeated forms and details that had been used on the two adjacent buildings (Nos. 111 and 112), but the scale is smaller. The Coast Guard converted the building for use as bachelor officers' quarters.
