<span class="title">1910 Bachelor Officers' Quarters (409)</span> 

<div id="copy">

Hay Road, South of Comfort Road
<P>
A 1910 structure built in the Colonial Revival style, Building 409 is a 2&#189 story residence, faced with brown brick laid in common bond above a limestone foundation. It has a T-shaped plan with the main block facing Hay Road and the rear wing projecting east. Both sections have slate-covered hipped roofs with hipped-roof dormers. A two-story wood porch extends across the entire west facade. At the first story level, square wood posts on pedestals are linked by wood balustrades. At the second story level, round Tuscan columns, linked by wood balustrades, support a shallow hipped roof. Wood cornices accent the rooflines. Garages have been added at the north and south sides of the building.
<P>
Building 409 was constructed in 1910 as bachelor officers' quarters at the north end of Regimental Row facing Hay Road. By that time the other officers' quarters to the south had been constructed, and the new landfill project was well underway. Larger in size than the one- and two-unit dwellings, Building 409 still shares a similarity of form and detail with them. Particularly notable is the double-story full length porch.
<P>
When the Coast Guard was in residence in the mid-1980s, a swing-set and children's playground was installed in the front yard.
