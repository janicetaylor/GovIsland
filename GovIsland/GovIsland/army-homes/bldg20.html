<span class="title">1902 Officers' Quarters (20)</span> 

<div id="copy">

Facing Nolan Park, east of Evans Road
<P>
Building 20 is a two-family, three-story house, of wood frame construction in the Victorian/Colonial Revival style, set on a brick (at the east) and schist (at the west) foundation. Cross-shaped in plan, it has clapboard-covered walls and intersecting gabled roofs covered with asphalt shingles and punctuated by end chimneys. Wrap-around porches flanking the front projecting wing have square posts and shallow hipped roofs with decorative scrollwork brackets and balustrades. (The decorative scrollwork has been replicated from the earlier houses on Nolan Park. The original balustrades had turned posts.)
<P>
Building 20 was constructed in 1902 as company officers' housing when Fort Columbus was the Headquarters of the Military Division of the Atlantic and the Department of the East. Facing east onto The Green (Nolan Park), it was the last of the officers' quarters to be constructed here. While it followed the general form of the earlier buildings, it was designed with Colonial Revival detail. Although reconfigured in 1936-38 as a two-family house, it retains its historic character, especially with the restoration of the clapboard siding, wood trim, and partially-open front porch in recent years.
<P>
An early resident of the house was the commander of the island, Brigadier General Frederick Dent Grant (1850-1912), the eldest son of President Ulysses S. Grant.  A veteran of numerous army campaigns, the younger Grant was the post commander in 1904, 1907 and 1910. Grant filled the home with his extensive collection of memorabilia collected with his wife, Ida, on numerous international journeys. On April 12, 1912, Grant died of cancer in New York City's Hotel Buckingham, and his remains were brought to Fort Jay for a full Army send-off. He is buried in the cemetery of the United States Military Academy at West Point.
