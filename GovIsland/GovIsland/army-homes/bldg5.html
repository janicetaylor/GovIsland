<!-- BEGIN DESCRIPTION HERE --> 

<span class="title">1855 Officers' Quarters (5)</span> 

<div id="copy">

Facing Nolan Park, west of Barry Road
<P>
Building 5 was constructed in 1855-1857 as one of a pair of field officers' houses, each designed with two units, on the east side of The Green (Nolan Park) as the post at Fort Columbus was expanding in the 1850s. Italianate vernacular in design, the pair set the form and scale for subsequent officers' housing constructed later in the century facing the green. While some additions have been made to the house, it retains its 19th Century character, especially with the restoration of the clapboard siding and open front porch in recent years.
