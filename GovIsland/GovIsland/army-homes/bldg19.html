<!-- BEGIN DESCRIPTION HERE --> 

<span class="title">1891 Officers' Quarters (19)</span> 

<div id="copy">

Facing Nolan Park, east of Evans Road
<P>
Building 19 is a two-family, two-story house, of wood frame construction in the Victorian vernacular style, set on a brick foundation. Cross-shaped in plan, it has clapboard-covered walls and intersecting gabled roofs covered with asphalt shingles and punctuated by end chimneys. Paired decorative brackets are placed under the roof eaves. Wrap-around porches flanking the front projecting wing have square posts and shallow hipped roofs with decorative scrollwork brackets and balustrades.
<P>
Building 19 was constructed in 1891 as company officers' housing during the years that Fort Columbus was the Headquarters of the Military Division of the Atlantic and the Department of the East. Facing east onto The Green (Nolan Park), it followed the form of the earlier officers' quarters, while being one of the first buildings constructed on Governors Island according to standardized Quartermaster General plans. It retains its 19th Century character, especially with the restoration of the clapboard siding, quarter-sawn wood trim, and open front porch in recent years.
