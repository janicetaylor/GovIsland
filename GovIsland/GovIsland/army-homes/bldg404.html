<span class="title">1902 Officers' Quarters (404)</span> 

<div id="copy">
Clayton Road, South of Comfort Road
<P>
Constructed in 1902 in the Colonial Revival style, Building 404 is a 2&#189 story brick double house faced with red pressed brick and set on a foundation of schist. A gabled front section projects from the gabled-roof main block of the house. Two gabled-roof wings project from the rear of the house. The original entrance porches have been removed from the house and the brickwork and entrances redone. Raking denticulated wood cornices outline the gable ends, and denticulated wood cornices set off the main roof slopes. The north and south gables enclose Palladian windows.
<P>
Building 404 was built as one of a group of six brick houses facing the old southwestern shoreline of Governors Island, now approximately the line of Hay Road. This group, designed according to standardized Quartermaster General plans, incorporated five double sets (Buildings 404, 405, 406, 407 and 408) of officers' housing as well as a single-unit dwelling (Building 403). The houses share general forms and material, although the details vary slightly with the construction dates. In 1952 when Building 404 was converted into a four-unit dwelling, the front porch was removed and the entrances modified.
