<span class="title">1895 Officers' Quarters (408)</span> 

<div id="copy">

Hay Road, South of Comfort Road
<P>
Constructed in 1895 in the Romanesque Revival style, Building 408 is a 2&#189 story double house faced with red pressed brick and set on a base of rusticated schist. A gabled front section projects from the gabled-roof main block of the house. Two gabled-roof wings project from the rear of the house. Gabled dormers with paired windows project from the main roof slope. The two entrance porches have brick columns (not original) supporting shallow hipped roofs covered with standing seam metal. Raking wood cornices outline the gable ends with denticulation below the gable pediments, and denticulated wood cornices set off the main roof slopes. A small brick garage has been added to the north side of the house, and a basement level garage approached by a ramp with retaining walls has been added to the south side.
<P>
Building 408 was built as one of a group of six brick houses facing the old southwestern shoreline of Governors Island, now approximately the line of Hay Road. This group, designed according to standardized Quartermaster General plans, incorporated five double sets (Buildings 404, 405, 406, 407 and 408) of officers' housing as well as a single-unit dwelling (Building 403). The houses share general forms and material, although the details vary slightly with the construction dates. Buildings 407 and 408 were the second two houses to be constructed.
