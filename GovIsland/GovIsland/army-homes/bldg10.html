<!-- BEGIN DESCRIPTION HERE --> 

<span class="title">1878 Officers' Quarters (10)</span> 

<div id="copy">

Facing Nolan Park, northwest of Barry Road
<P>
Building 10 is a two-family, two-story house, of wood frame construction set on a brick foundation. T-shaped in plan, it has clapboard-covered walls and a gabled roof.
<P>
Building 10, built as one of a pair with Building 8, was constructed in 1878 as company officers' housing during the year that Fort Columbus became the Headquarters of the Military Division of the Atlantic and the Department of the East, a change in status which gave rise to an increased demand for officers' housing. Victorian vernacular in design and facing The Green (Nolan Park), it followed the form of Buildings 4 and 5, and it was joined by eight other units (Buildings 6, 7, 8, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18) built that same year. While some additions have been made to the house and the middle front dormer has been enlarged, it retains its 19th Century character, especially with the restoration of the clapboard siding and open front porch in recent years.
