<span class="title">Visitor Info: Subway</span> 

<div id="copy">

Downtown construction frequently disrupts subway service. Before your trip, be sure to check subway status on <a href="http://www.mta.info" TARGET="new">mta.info</A> and on Twitter @NYCTSubwayScoop. MTA Travel Info dial 718-330-1234. New York State Travel and Transit Dial 511. 
<P>
Subways to the Battery Maritime Building located at 10 South Street: The two closest stations are the 1 (South Ferry Station) and R (Whitehall Street Station). The two stations were connected together recently, and both share an exit directly across from the Staten Island Ferry terminal, next door to the Battery Maritime Building. However, only the South Ferry Station is accessible with an elevator to the street for wheelchairs, strollers and bicycles. Whitehall Street Station is not ADA compliant.
