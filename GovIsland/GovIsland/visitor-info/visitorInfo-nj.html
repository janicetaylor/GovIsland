<!-- BEGIN DESCRIPTION HERE --> 

<span class="title">Visitor Info: New Jersey</span> 

<div id="copy">

In 2009, a deer swam from Jersey City to Governors Island (the poor guy was captured and released on Staten Island). But there are easier ways to get from the Garden State to Governors Island.
<P>
PATH: From Christopher Street or Penn Station, take the 1 downtown to South Ferry station. The station is next door to the Battery Maritime Building and Governors Island ferry.
<P>
Ferry: Weehawken or Hoboken terminals makes stops at Governors Island on Saturdays and Sundays only during the summer.  Cost $3 or $5.50 per trip under a two-zone ticket system, with one zone meaning three stops or less, and two zones, four stops or more. 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. on weekends.
