Because the island is only open on a limited basis six months out of the year, there aren't any permanent restaurants or cafes on the island. At the moment, the best option for eating on the island is to bring your own picnic lunch. With more than 60 acres of open space, there is plenty of room to find a nice spot. The Trust for Governors Island, the organization that manages the island, has lined up many food vendors and concessionaires that are spread across the island. Among them are:

Water Taxi Beach Bar & Grill<BR> 
This wonderful Bar & Grill is located in the Water Taxi Beach venue, to the right of the Backstage Cafe space. It has all the things you could think of: hamburgers, hotdogs, roasted corn, fresh cut potatoes, and have course a bar.
