<B>Bicycling</B><BR>
See the separate Bicycling Info section; bring your bike on the ferry!
<P>
<B>Fishing</B><BR>
Anglers are allowed to drop their lines on the South Side of the island, on Buttermilk Channel. However, all fish caught must be put back; strict catch-and-release rules apply due to city and state law.
<P>
<B>Kayak around Governors Island</B><BR>
Kayaking is scheduled for specifics weekend days throughout the season at Pier 101. The Trust for Governors Island <a href="http://www.govisland.com" target="NEW">web site</A> will announce when kayaking is permitted. Kayaking is run by the <a href="http://www.downtownboathouse.org" target="NEW">Downtown Boathouse</A>, an all volunteer-run nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free public access to the harbor in New York City through public kayaking programs. The public kayaks are sit-on-top kayaks. The boats are unsinkable and self-bailing. Any water that splashes up on the boat drains out the holes in the bottom. The kayaking dock is open for any kayakers to land at on Friday-Sunday during the Island's operating hours.
<P>
<B>Running: Lace Up Your Shoes</B><BR>
Governors Island is one of the greatest places to go running in New York. The island is car-free, the surfaces are flat, and the breeze coming off the water is refreshing. The downside is there are no changing rooms or shower facilities, so keep that in mind. The entire loop around the island is 2.2 miles. There are other roads that chris-cross through the island, but remember; it is only five blocks wide at the widest point! It would be advisable to bring along your own bottled water, because facilities are sparse. For serious runners, don't miss the annual 10K race Get Outside on Governors Island to be held June 26, 2011.
<P>
<B>Walking: Stroll Across History</B><BR>
A visit to Governors Island is a walker's paradise. A smooth roadway wraps around the perimeter of the island, and the 2.2-mile loop provides stunning views of lower Manhattan, the Statue of Liberty, New Jersey and Brooklyn. The island pathways cut through more than 60 acres of open green space. Areas of shade can be found in places such as Nolan Park, an 1871 green space that is lined with the former residences of senior military officers. The old parade ground, once a golf course, is a terrific grass-covered walk around historic Fort Jay, the island's landmark fortress. It's recommended that walkers bring bottles of water and comfortable shoes. Note: pets are not allowed on the island; so dog walking is not an activity to be enjoyed.
