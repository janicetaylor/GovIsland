<!-- BEGIN DESCRIPTION HERE --> 

<span class="title">Concertgoer Info</span> 

<div id="copy">
If you want to enjoy attending live music events on Governors Island, here is what you need to know.
<P>
The island runs free ferry service on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays to the island from Manhattan and Brooklyn. Your concert ticket, depending on the event and the promoter, should allow you access to returning ferries to Manhattan and Brooklyn after the free ferries stop at 7 p.m. Check with the concert promoter web site. You won't get stuck on the island overnight.
<P>
Your bags will be searched before you get on the ferry. Keep this in mind. Concertgoers are allowed to only bring in one factory-sealed bottle of water. No coolers, bags or food can be taken to the large shows on South Island Field or Water Taxi Beach. However, the smaller venues on the Parade Grounds and Brick Row Park (sometimes incorrectly called Colonel's Row), you can bring a picnic lunch and drinks.
<P>
The Jazz Age Lawn Party, in June and August, allows attendees to bring their own food and non-alcoholic drinks. With a liquor license, organizers run a cash bar, and alcohol will be served to those with government-issue ID.
<P>
What's the best experience? Arrive early. Eat on the island, at either one of the numerous food vendor carts spread around the island or at Water Taxi Beach. Or bring your own food and drink and eat it in one of the many green spaces on the island. Then walk into your show!
