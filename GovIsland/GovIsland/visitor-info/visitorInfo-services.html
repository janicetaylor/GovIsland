<B>ATM</B><BR>
Need cash? There are ATMs located on Governors Island. They are located at Water Taxi Beach and in building 140, the Governors Island security building.
<P>
<B>Bike Tours</B><BR> 
The National Park Foundation's Active Trails program, a ranger-led historical tour around the island, takes visitors across the entire island on two wheels. Information can be found at Fort Jay.
<P>
<B>Mobile Phone Reception</B><BR>
The service can be spotty for mobile phones on Governors Island. For best reception, stand on the south side of the island, near Buttermilk Channel. If you are closer to Brooklyn the signal will improve. Standing on top of Fort Jay also helps! If you are planning to talk or text on the island, be aware that the service can be intermittent during peak times of the day.
<P>
<B>Public Restrooms</B><BR>
The number of public restroom facilities is growing each year that Governors Island is open. The island has deployed portable toilets strategically across the island. There are indoor facilities in Building 110.
<P>
<B>Security</B><BR>
There are security officers in Building 140, which is the building right at the entrance to the ferry line. 
<P>
<B>Tram Rides</B><BR>
There are two tram tours that are on Governors Island, and they are both free of charge. The Historic District Tram Tour begins at Fort Jay and takes riders around the historic district. The tour gives you history about the island itself, and ends behind Liggett Hall. The Picnic Point Tram begins behind Liggett Hall, where the Historic Tour ends! This tram will bring visitors all the way to Picnic Point, at the tip of the island.
<P>
<B>Walking Tours</B><BR>
There are two types of guided walking tours, free and admission. The National Park Service provides free walking tours of the National Monument, conducted by its rangers, on Saturdays and Sundays, subject to the availability of rangers. Tours begin in Fort Jay. More information can be found in the National Park Headquarters. Sightseeing guides who are Officially Licensed by the City of New York provide the other walking tours for a small fee. Information on these walking tours is provided <a href="http://www.governorsislandguide.com" target="NEW">here</A>.
